recrun
======

recrun is an acronym that stands for *retain essential content, remove unwanted noise*.
It presents article web pages in a format optimized for reading.

To use recrun, install the extension, navigate to an article web page,
and click the eyeglasses icon in the browser toolbar (there is an arrow pointing
to this icon in the recrun screenshot).

Optionally, recrun can use the [Diffbot Article API][diffbot_article_api] to extract
relevant content. A Diffbot token is required for this, and must be entered in recrun's
options.

The extension is available for Chrome at

The extension is available for Firefox at
